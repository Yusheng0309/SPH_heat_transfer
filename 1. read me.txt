Smoothed Particle Hydyodynamics (SPH) is a kind of numerical simulation method.

It is meshless and uses moving particles as the computationl nodes.

This project is trying to simulate heat transfer by solving the partial differential equations.

The PDEs  include the Navier-Stokes equations and transport equation.
